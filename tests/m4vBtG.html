      The next time you feel frustrated because you don't have Nicole Kidman's porcelain skin,
      Jennifer Aniston's beautiful hair or David Beckham's muscular body, have a look through
      some gossip magazines. It might make you feel better to see pictures of your favourite
      Hollywood icons without their make-up on. Take a closer look at a star's picture that hasn't
      been retouched, and you'll discover that many of them are ordinary-looking people, just like
      you and me!

      A long time ago, clothes were simply a way of covering our bodies. Of course, there have
      always been preferences in one style or another, but fashion rarely used to define who we
      are. Today, things are different. Our clothes make a statement about our personality and our
      lifestyle. Teens, especially, associate the way they dress with the image they want to show
      others. It's not really about being fashionable anymore; it's rather about showing our identity
      through our choice of outfit.

      With more and more people turning their attention to our planet's growing problems, it's no
      wonder that the fashion industry is also doing so. Eco-safe materials, organic colouring
      substances and even clothes made from recycled materials are now easier to find and are
      becoming more and more popular with today's shoppers.

      People have always had the need to set their own fashion trends, and there is no better
      witness to this fact than the Fashion Museum in Bath, England. With a display of original
      outfits dating from the 1700s to modern day, fashion enthusiasts will be thrilled to see not
      only authentic gowns worn by English kings and queens, but also some of the dresses made
      famous by the legendary Hollywood actress Marilyn Monroe

      William Ivey Long is one of the greatest costumes designers of our time. His extraordinary
      work in Hairspray, Chicago and other Broadway and off-Broadway plays has won him five
      Tony awards and twice as many nominations. His costumes are clever, original and a perfect
      expression of the character they are created for. The highlight in Long's career was in 2006,
      when he was admitted to the Theatre Hall of Fame.
