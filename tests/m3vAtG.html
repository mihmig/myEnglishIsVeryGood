  <h3>A dream come true</h3>
  <p>
    As a teenager, my brother Al used to invent little things as a pastime. After the gadget phase, he started
    making toy aeroplanes out of wood or plastic. His creations were quite impressive for someone so young.
    His room was always full of books about famous pilots and jet aeroplanes that he read again and again.
    His dream was to sell his model aeroplanes in his own shop one day, so he was determined to learn all
    about flying, and even designed all his models on a 3-D computer programme, before he built them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Neither of my parents opposed Al&#39;s decision. They both believed that people should be keen on their
    jobs, but our father wanted him to get a university degree first. Our mother thought that a good education
    was necessary, especially because she had doubts about if he could earn a good living with his aeroplanes.
    On the other hand, she couldn&#39;t see how becoming a lawyer or a doctor for example, would help Al with
    the job he wanted to do. 
  </p>
  <p>
    When Al finished school, he finally decided to get a degree in architecture. During his studies, Al
    continued his hobby in his spare time, but also got involved in other things. He played football for a while,
    volunteered at the school&#39;s library, and joined the drama club; though he soon decided that acting wasn&#39;t
    for him.
  </p>
  <p>
    As soon as Al graduated, he and another dozen students took a tour of Europe. The highlight of Al&#39;s
    trip was France. He even considered moving there for a short time to improve his skills in French, but he
    wanted to return home to prove to himself that he could succeed as a businessman. Three years later, Al
    accomplished his goal, and today, he is so successful, that he has five shops in our city and is planning to
    open more around the country. And, who knows, maybe one day his model airplanes will be famous
    around the world!
