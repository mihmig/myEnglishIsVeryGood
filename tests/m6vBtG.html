  <h3>A symbol of Paris</h3>
  <p>
    Being one of the most popular sites in the world, the Eiffel Tower attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists every year. In fact, the structure, received its two hundredth millionth guest in 2002.
  </p>
  <p>
    Located on the Champs de Mars by the Seine River, visitors can make their way to the top and admire the breathtaking view of Paris.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Tower was the inspiration of French engineer Gustave Eiffel.
 </p>
  <p>
    A very famous personality in his time, Eiffel had also done important work for the internal structure of another famous monument, the Statue of Liberty in the USA.
  </p>
  <p>
    Work on the Eiffel Tower began in 1887 and lasted until 1889, when the building was opened to the public during the Paris World Exposition. Until 1930 and the construction of the Chrysler Building in New York, the Tower remained the highest structure in the world.

  <p>
    Many people, especially artists, criticised the structure saying that this distasteful structure did not fit in with the beauty of Paris, One of these critics was the French writer Guy de Maupassant, who ate at one of the tower's restaurants almost every day, because it was the only place in Paris from where the tower was not visible, and so he wouldn't have to see it!
  </p>
  <p>
    A lot of effort and money go into keeping the Tower in good condition Every seven years, sixty metric tons of paint are used to repaint it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Different shades of the same colour are used on the top and darker ones on the bottom in order for the building to have an unvarying appearance.
