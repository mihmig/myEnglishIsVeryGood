  <h3>Too cool for school</h3>
  <p>
    You&#39;ve always wanted to be popular in school. You&#39;ve dreamt a thousand times what it would be like to be the star of your school&#39;s football team or that tall blonde girl who everyone fancies.
  </p>
  <p>
    ‘Cool&#39; people are attractive, confident and always wear stylish outfits. Everyone wants to hang out with them. But often “cool” people aren&#39;t very nice! They can be selfish and bossy. At times they get impatient with people who might be shy or a bit quiet.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you really want to make some true friends, here are some tips. Don&#39;t choose friends based on looks. What really matters in a friend is not being slim and beautiful but reliable and generous. Choose friends who are humorous, talkative and who never treat others badly. In fact, these are the people who are truly cool! Try to choose friends that you can actually benefit from. Those who are creative and have interests other than fashion and parties.
  </p>
  <p>
    Be flexible but don&#39;t say or do things that make you feel uncomfortable just to make ‘cool&#39; people like you. Always speak your mind. Those who really care for you will still be your friends- even if at times you drive them crazy. Remember: real friends are those you can open up to. Those who will hold their tongue and will never give away your secrets.
  </p>
  <p>
    Take a minute and think. What really matters? Making friends that count or counting friends?
