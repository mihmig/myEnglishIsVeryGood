  <h3>Taking a Break in the Wild</h3>
  <p>
    Last summer, my friend Katie and I decided to go on a summer holiday together. We really needed to take
    time away from work and our busy city schedules

    We both wished to something exciting and
    challenging, but at the same time, we wanted our excursion to be a truly educational experience. Luckily, a
    colleague at work had told Katie about a holiday package which combined training in wildlife survival skills
    along with nature exploration.

    The idea seemed appealing,

    On the first day of the programme, we met our instructor, who told us to bear in mind that this was a
    first-time experience for all the members in the group

    ,which was quite a relief to hear.

    At the start of the programme, we developed a deep understanding of plants and animals in the wild. After that, we

    , as well as recognise their particular eating habits and native habitats. We also learned how
    to gather wild plants and prepare them for food or medicine.

    During our last week, we mastered the art of building shelters out of trees and bushes, learned how to locate clean water
