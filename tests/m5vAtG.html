        We need energy to heat our homes, cook and clean for our families and for transport. It allows us to live a comfortable and easy life. However, if we do not use this energy properly we will soon run out. Luckily, there are things we can all do to help our planet and conserve our resources.
    </p>
    <p>
        To begin with, much of the energy used at home goes to heating or cooling our homes. A simple way to help conserve energy is by lowering the thermostat by two degrees in the winter and raising it by two in the summer. By doing so, you will not only lower your heating bill, but you will also reduce the amount of carbon dioxide that enters the atmosphere.

        Another way you can save energy at home is by buying energy-saving appliances. Appliances like washing machines and cookers use a great deal of gas or electricity to work. When shopping for new appliances, look for the energy-saving sticker; they might be a little more expensive to buy, but they help save energy, and in the end will help you save money on your bills.

        A lot of energy is used by means of transport too. One of the many ways to achieve low energy usage is to leave the car at home and catch the bus or the train to move around the city. Fewer cars in the street means less traffic and it will not only help save energy, but it will also reduce the amount of air pollution.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the end, it is up to every individual to take responsibility and change their daily habits. If everyone does their part, then we can help save energy and our planet's resources.
